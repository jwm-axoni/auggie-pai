# Web Application Security Assessment

Skill for systematic web application security testing following OWASP methodology.
Coordinates with Recon (for target discovery) and Prompt Injection (for LLM-specific attacks).

## When to Use This Skill

Activate when the user requests:
- "web assessment", "pentest", "security assessment", "security test"
- "OWASP testing", "vulnerability scan", "test for vulnerabilities"
- "test web app", "application security", "app sec"
- "fuzz", "content discovery", "directory brute force"
- "test authentication", "test authorization", "test for injection"
- Any request involving web application vulnerability testing

## Authorization and Ethical Requirements

**CRITICAL -- Read before any action.**

### Mandatory Rules

1. **Authorization first** -- never test without explicit written permission
2. **Scope validation** -- confirm target URLs/domains are in-scope before any testing
3. **No destructive testing** -- avoid actions that could cause data loss or service disruption
4. **Rate limiting** -- space requests to avoid overloading targets
5. **Document everything** -- log all tests, payloads, and findings with timestamps
6. **Responsible disclosure** -- follow coordinated disclosure for any vulnerabilities found

### Before Starting Any Assessment

Ask and confirm:
- Do you have written authorization to test this application?
- What is the exact scope (URLs, endpoints, functionality)?
- Are there any excluded areas or actions (e.g., production databases, destructive writes)?
- What is the testing window (dates/times)?
- Who is the point of contact if issues arise?

**If authorization is unclear, STOP and ask for clarification.**

## Systematic Testing Process

Follow this 6-phase methodology:

### Phase 0: Scoping and Preparation
- Define target application and scope boundaries
- Confirm authorization documentation
- Identify testing constraints (rate limits, excluded functionality)
- Set up testing notes and reporting structure

### Phase 1: Reconnaissance
- Use the Recon skill for infrastructure discovery
- Identify subdomains, endpoints, technology stack
- Map the application: pages, forms, APIs, authentication flows
- Use claude-browser MCP to walk through the application interactively

### Phase 2: Application Mapping
- Enumerate all entry points: forms, URL parameters, headers, cookies
- Identify user roles and access levels
- Map user flows and sensitive data handling
- Document the technology stack (server, framework, CDN, third-party services)
- Identify API endpoints and their methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)

### Phase 3: Vulnerability Testing
- Test against each OWASP Top 10 category (see below)
- Prioritize based on threat model and attack surface
- Use systematic test cases per category
- Record all test inputs and responses

### Phase 4: Exploitation and Validation
- Validate findings with proof-of-concept demonstrations
- Confirm severity with reproducible steps
- Assess real-world impact of each vulnerability
- Avoid accessing data beyond what is needed for proof

### Phase 5: Reporting
- Compile findings into structured vulnerability report
- Include severity, description, proof, and remediation for each finding
- Provide executive summary and technical details

## OWASP Top 10 Testing Areas

### A01: Broken Access Control
- Test horizontal privilege escalation (access other users' data)
- Test vertical privilege escalation (access admin functions)
- Test forced browsing to unlinked pages
- Verify CORS configuration
- Test IDOR (Insecure Direct Object Reference) on all endpoints

### A02: Cryptographic Failures
- Check TLS configuration: `curl -vI https://target.com 2>&1`
- Look for sensitive data in URLs, logs, or error messages
- Verify password storage (no plaintext, proper hashing)
- Check for weak or missing encryption on sensitive data in transit

### A03: Injection
- SQL injection on all input fields and parameters
- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): reflected, stored, DOM-based
- Command injection where system commands may be constructed
- LDAP, XML, template injection where applicable
- Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)

### A04: Insecure Design
- Business logic flaws (price manipulation, workflow bypass)
- Race conditions in critical operations
- Missing rate limiting on sensitive endpoints
- Insufficient anti-automation

### A05: Security Misconfiguration
- Default credentials on admin interfaces
- Unnecessary HTTP methods enabled
- Directory listing enabled
- Verbose error messages exposing stack traces
- Missing security headers (CSP, X-Frame-Options, HSTS)

### A06: Vulnerable and Outdated Components
- Identify component versions from response headers and content
- Use WebSearch to check for known CVEs
- Check JavaScript libraries for known vulnerabilities

### A07: Identification and Authentication Failures
- Brute force protection on login
- Password policy strength
- Session management (token entropy, expiration, fixation)
- Multi-factor authentication bypass
- Password reset flow vulnerabilities

### A08: Software and Data Integrity Failures
- Check for unsigned/unverified updates or data
- Insecure deserialization
- CI/CD pipeline integrity (if in scope)
- Mass assignment vulnerabilities

### A09: Security Logging and Monitoring Failures
- Verify logging of authentication events
- Check for log injection possibilities
- Assess monitoring/alerting coverage

### A10: Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)
- Test URL parameters that fetch external resources
- Internal network scanning via SSRF
- Cloud metadata endpoint access (169.254.169.254)

## Available Tools

### claude-browser MCP
- Interactive browser-based testing through Axonius service URLs
- Walk through authentication flows, form submissions, UI testing
- Capture screenshots and DOM state
- Test client-side behavior and JavaScript execution

### WebFetch and curl
- API endpoint testing: `curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"key":"value"}' https://api.target.com/endpoint`
- Header inspection: `curl -sI https://target.com`
- Authentication testing: `curl -b "session=token" https://target.com/admin`
- File upload testing, parameter manipulation, method testing

### WebSearch
- Research known vulnerabilities for identified technologies
- Find CVE details and exploitation guidance
- Look up security advisories for detected software versions

### System Commands
- `curl` -- HTTP requests with full control over headers, methods, body
- `dig`/`nslookup` -- DNS verification
- `openssl s_client` -- TLS/SSL analysis
- `base64`, `xxd` -- Encoding/decoding for payload crafting

## Integration with Other Skills

## Examples

### Example 1: Full Assessment
```
User: "Security assessment on app.example.com"
--> Confirm authorization
--> Phase 0: Define scope (app.example.com/*)
--> Phase 1: Recon (technology stack, subdomains)
--> Phase 2: Map application (endpoints, roles, flows)
--> Phase 3: Test OWASP Top 10 categories
--> Phase 4: Validate and document findings
--> Phase 5: Generate vulnerability report
```

### Example 2: Targeted Testing
```
User: "Test the login page at auth.example.com for vulnerabilities"
--> Confirm authorization and scope (auth.example.com/login only)
--> Focus on A07 (Authentication), A01 (Access Control), A03 (Injection)
--> Test brute force protection, session handling, credential security
--> Generate focused report
```

### Example 3: API Security
```
User: "Test the REST API at api.example.com"
--> Confirm authorization
--> Map all API endpoints (WebFetch + curl)
--> Test authentication, authorization, input validation
--> Check for IDOR, mass assignment, rate limiting
--> Generate API security report
```

## Key Principles

1. **Understand before testing** -- build an application narrative first
2. **Threat model guides testing** -- do not test blindly; prioritize by risk
3. **Breadth then depth** -- wide reconnaissance, then focused exploitation
4. **Document everything** -- every test, every payload, every response
5. **Minimize impact** -- avoid disruption to production systems

**Remember:** Authorization is mandatory. Understand the application before attacking it.
Test systematically, document thoroughly, and report responsibly.
