## What is Auggie PAI?

An adaptation of Daniel Miessler's [PAI (Personal AI Infrastructure)](https://github.com/danielmiessler/PAI) for the **Augment Code CLI**.

PAI transforms AI coding assistants from stateless chat into a structured execution system with persistent memory, verifiable criteria, and repeatable methodology. Auggie PAI brings that same rigor to the Augment CLI environment.

**What you get:**
- A **7-phase Algorithm** that structures every non-trivial task
- **18 skills** across thinking, research, security, and personas
- **Persistent memory** that learns from every session
- **ISC (Ideal State Criteria)** — atomic, binary-testable criteria that define "done"
- **PRD tracking** — structured work artifacts that survive context loss

## The Algorithm

<p align="center">
  <img src="images/auggie-pai-algorithm.png" alt="The Algorithm — 7-Phase Execution Loop" width="100%">
</p>

The Algorithm is PAI's core execution engine. Every non-trivial request flows through 7 phases:

| Phase | What Happens |
|-------|-------------|
| **OBSERVE** | Reverse-engineer the request. Extract explicit wants, implied wants, what's NOT wanted. Generate ISC criteria. Select capabilities. |
| **THINK** | Pressure test. Premortem. Identify riskiest assumptions. Refine criteria through the Splitting Test. |
| **PLAN** | Validate prerequisites. Create execution plan. File-edit manifest for multi-file work. |
| **BUILD** | Create artifacts. Invoke each selected capability. Constraint checkpoint after each artifact. |
| **EXECUTE** | Run the work. Continuously verify against criteria — don't batch to end. Mark PRD checkboxes as criteria pass. |
| **VERIFY** | Mechanical verification of every criterion. No rubber-stamping. Specific evidence required. |
| **LEARN** | Reflect. Capture patterns. Write to persistent memory for future sessions. |

### Mode Selection

Not everything needs the full Algorithm:

| Mode | When | Example |
|------|------|---------|
| **MINIMAL** | Greetings, acknowledgments | "hello", "thanks" |
| **NATIVE** | Quick tasks under 2 minutes | "what's 2+2", "rename this var" |
| **ALGORITHM** | Everything non-trivial | "build a caching layer", "debug this auth flow" |

### Effort Levels

The Algorithm scales to match the task:

| Tier | Time Budget | ISC Criteria | Min Skills |
|------|------------|-------------|-----------|
| Standard | <2 min | 8–16 | 1–2 |
| Extended | <8 min | 16–32 | 3–5 |
| Advanced | <16 min | 24–48 | 4–7 |
| Deep | <32 min | 40–80 | 6–10 |
| Comprehensive | <2 hrs | 64–150 | 8–15 |

### ISC — Ideal State Criteria

The secret sauce. Every task is decomposed into **atomic, binary-testable criteria** before any work begins.

Each criterion must pass the **Splitting Test**:
1. **"And"/"With" test** — joining two verifiable things? Split.
2. **Independent failure test** — can part A pass while B fails? Split.
3. **Scope word test** — "all", "every", "complete"? Enumerate what "all" means.
4. **Domain boundary test** — crosses UI/API/data boundaries? One criterion per boundary.

```
Bad:  "Blog publishing handles draft to published with SEO metadata"
Good: "Draft status stored in frontmatter YAML field"
      "Published timestamp set on first publish only"
      "Meta description under 160 characters"
      "Canonical URL set to published permalink"
```

## System Architecture

<p align="center">
  <img src="images/auggie-pai-architecture.png" alt="System Architecture — Core Components" width="100%">
</p>

### Five Core Components

**Algorithm** (`rules/algorithm.md`) — The 7-phase execution loop. Injected into every prompt via `alwaysApply: true` frontmatter. This is the brain.

**Skills** (`skills/`) — 18 self-contained methodologies the Algorithm can invoke during BUILD/EXECUTE. Each has a `SKILL.md` defining triggers, methodology, and output format.

**Memory** (`MEMORY/`) — Persistent across sessions. Reflections from LEARN phases, user corrections, synthesized patterns, and active work state.

<p align="center">
  <img src="images/auggie-pai-memory.png" alt="Memory System — Persistent Across Sessions" width="100%">
</p>

**PRD Tracking** (`.prd/`) — Product Requirements Documents created during ALGORITHM mode. YAML frontmatter tracks phase, progress, effort. ISC criteria live as checkboxes. Survives context loss.

**Security** (`rules/security.md`) — Prompt injection defense, credential handling, SSRF awareness, destructive operation guards.

# Back up existing config if you have one
[ -d ~/.augment ] && mv ~/.augment ~/.augment.backup

git clone https://github.com/jwm-axoni/auggie-pai.git ~/.augment
